# TST Take-Home Assessment -  Kyler Rosquist

This project is based on Scala 2.13.14.

For context, I completed this assessment on MacOS, with the OpenJDK version of Java 11 installed, and sbt installed with brew.

## "Run Main" Instructions

1. Navigate to either `src/main/scala/tst/Promotion.scala` or `src/main/scala/tst/RateGroup.scala`
2. Run the main function to see the expected output (given the inputs provided by TST team)
3. Find the base (and a couple additional) tests in the following directory: `src/test/scala/tst/`
